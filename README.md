# Group 4 Project for CS 190N 2024 Fall UCSB

## Author: Xinghan Yang and Tiger Yu

This experiment seeks to explore the potential of building machine learning classifiers capable of consistently
classifying online video platforms — specifically YouTube, Vimeo and Twitch — based on only observable network traffic
patterns. We build several classification models based on packet-level features procured from controlled experiments,
and then test their performance on traffic crafted in varying manipulated environments: the use of proxy servers and
background network noise.
